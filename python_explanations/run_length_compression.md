# Implement Run-Length Encoding
Run-length encoding (RLE) compression offers a fast way to do efficient on-the-fly compression and decompression of strings. The idea is simple --- encode successive repeated characters by the repetition count and the character. For example, the RLE of "aaaabcccaa" is "4a1b3c2a". The decoding of "3e4f2e" returns "eeeffffee".  
  
Implement run-length encoding and decoding functions. Assume the string to be encoded consists of letters of the alphabet, with no digits, and the string to be decoded is valid encoding.
